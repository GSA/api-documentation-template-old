<h1>SAM searchData API</h1>
<p>The SAM Search API has been developed to  mimic the Search functionality that is currently available from the SAM  website. The Search API provides the opportunity to perform a search  transaction in the following two options. Quick Search takes a single search  term provided by the user and compares it to a set of predefined database  fields. Advanced Search allows the user to search by entering a value that is  then used to search a user selected predefined search category. <br />
  Notice that the searchData is through a  JSON-based &ldquo;hypermedia as the engine of application state&rdquo; (HATEOAS with the  appropriate links object within the result set). The intent going forward will  be to use this model to allow for a scalable architecture of IAE&rsquo;s APIs to be  built. </p>
<h2>Version 1 (v1)</h2>
<p>The following updates have been applied:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Added Advanced  Search features which allows users to search by specific fields</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Fields  added to the Advanced Search include:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>legalBusinessName,  status, duns, dunsPlus4, hasKnownExclusion, expirationDate, samAddress, cage,  dodaac, hasDelinquentFederalDebt</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>
<h2>Version 2 (v2)</h2>
<p>Deployed June 27, 2015</p>
<p>The following updates have been applied:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Added ability to  check companies that were added/updated /expired between 2 dates
    <ul>
      <li>Will  use the following format
        <ul>
          <li>expirationDate:[2015-01-01,2015-05-05]</li>
          <li>updateDate:[2015-01-01,2015-05-05]</li>
          <li>createDate:[2015-01-01,2015-05-05]</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
